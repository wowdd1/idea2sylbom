STA36759 | Statistical Models of the Brain | https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/courseDetails?COURSE=36759&SEMESTER=S19 | instructors:Kass, Robert description:This new course is intended for CNBC students, as an additional  option for fulfilling the computational core course requirement,  but it will also be open to Statistics and Machine Learning  students. It should be of interest to anyone wishing to see the  way statistical ideas play out within the brain sciences, and it  will provide a series of case studies on the role of stochastic  models in scientific investigation.  Statistical ideas have been part of neurophysiology and the brainsciences since the first stochastic description of spike trains, and the quantal hypothesis of neurotransmitter release, more than 50 years ago. Many contemporary theories of neural system behavior are built  with statistical models. For example, integrate-and-fire neurons are  usually assumed to be driven in part by stochastic noise; the role of  spike timing involves the distinction between Poisson and non-Poisson  neurons; and oscillations are characterized by decomposing variation  into frequency-based components.  In the visual system, V1 simple  cells are often described using linear-nonlinear Poisson models; in  the motor system, neural response may involve direction tuning; and  CA1 hippocampal receptive field plasticity has been characterized  using dynamic place models.  It has also been proposed that  perceptions, decisions, and actions result from optimal (Bayesian)  combination of sensory input with previously-learned regularities; and  some investigators report new insights from viewing whole-brain  pattern responses as analogous to statistical classifiers.  Throughout the field of statistics, models incorporating random ``noise components are used as an effective vehicle for data analysis. In neuroscience, however, the models also help form a conceptual framework for understanding neural function.  This course will examine some of the most important methods and  claims that have come from applying statistical thinking

STA36765 | Writing in StatisticsThis Section Cancelled | https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/courseDetails?COURSE=36765&SEMESTER=S19 | instructors:Junker, Brian description:There is no one correct way to write. But there are things you can do that tend to make it difficult for a reader to absorb the ideas you are writing about, or make it easier for the reader. Thus, it is important to focus on the reader, and the constraints and habits of mind that most readers (even in the rarefied population of academics who can understand the technical details of your work) bring to the task of reading what you have written. The goals for students in this course are: to understand that writing requires an intellectual investment similar to the investment that you put into other areas of your research, from developing research questions, data collection, and data analysis, to writing and testing algorithms, and formulating and proving theorems; to understand ways of organizing your writing that make it more likely that the reader will interpret and understand your ideas in the way that you intend; and to gain experience writing with these ideas in mind. The course is most suitable for graduate students in statistics who are engaged in a writing project (ADA paper, journal article, thesis work, etc.).

This course will present a unified derivation of a wide-variety of new and old concentration inequalities for martingales.
