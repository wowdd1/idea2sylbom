ICT04330 | Fundamentals of Software Development and Problem Solving | https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/courseDetails?COURSE=04330&SEMESTER=F18 | instructors:Bishop, Mary description:This course explores the discipline of computer science through a hands-on focus on practical programming skills. Topics include algorithm development, problem solving (decomposition and synthesis), program design, data representation, arithmetic and logical expressions, input/output operations, basic user interfaces, and object-oriented programming and design, with an emphasis on developing good programming habits. Intensive programing assignments are required. The programming will involve understanding and analyzing a set of requirements for a problem, formulating a solution, and implementing that solution on the computer along with tests that show that the program achieves its goals.  These programs can be intensive and fun, and are designed to provide the student with a clear understanding of principals needed to work with the computer in the future http://public.rwanda.cmu.edu/cbishop/pfun/syllabus.html
