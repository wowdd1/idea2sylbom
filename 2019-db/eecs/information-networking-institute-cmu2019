Additionally, students will be required to follow sound forensic methodologies to protect and prepare digital evidence throughout their mock investigations. Furthermore, students will learn to effectively summarize and communicate their forensic analysis through technical report writing and communication best practices.  Upon completion of this course, students will be prepared to participate in and guide enterprise cyber security security incident response and forensic operations for large organizations.  Prerequisites: 14761, 14822 and 14823.
INI14840 | Mobile Hardware for Software Engineers | https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/courseDetails?COURSE=14840&SEMESTER=F18 | instructors:Zhang, Pei description:This course enables students to analyze the implications of mobile hardware capabilities and restrictions in order to plan and develop mobile applications. Students will be able to devise and interface simple hardware additions to mobile platforms such as cell-phones, internet tablets and wireless sensors. The course covers the elements of embedded systems development, such as hardware fundamentals, real-time operating systems, interrupts, and cross-development, as well mobile topics such as power management, machine-to-machine communication, radio/RF subsystems and wireless protocols. Topics typically include: USB, GPIO, blue-tooth, cellular networks, 802.11, Zigbee, RFID, NFC, cameras, audio, etc. Student teams will undertake small HW/SW interfacing projects to sharpen their experience. Unlike a conventional hardware course, the course would instead focus on the software implications, rather than the CPU and radio.  Prerequisites: Some understanding of basic electrical terminology and Java programming required; C programming desired.
INI14841 | Mobile &amp; Pervasive Computing | https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/courseDetails?COURSE=14841&SEMESTER=S19 | instructors:Zhang, Pei prereq:15605 or 15410 description:This is a course exploring research issues in the newly emerging field of mobile computing. Many traditional areas of computer science and computer engineering are impacted by the constraints and demands of mobility. Examples include network protocols, power management, user interfaces, file access, ergonomics, and security. This will be an advanced course in the truest sense --- most, if not all, the topics discussed will be ones where there is little consensus in the research community on the best approaches. The course will also offer significant hand-on experience in this area. Each student will have to present and lead the discussion on a number of papers. Students will work in groups of three under the guidance of a mentor on a hands-on project. Each student will also be required to write one of two documents: (a) a research proposal (similar in spirit to an NSF proposal) on an idea in mobile computing or (b) a short business plan for a commercial opportunity in mobile computing. Grading will be based on the quality of the presentations, the project, and the proposal or business plan. Prerequisites: 15-410 and senior or graduate standing.
INI14848 | Cloud Infrastructure: Design, Analysis and Implementation | https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/courseDetails?COURSE=14848&SEMESTER=F18 | instructors:Kesden, Gregory description:Cloud Computing can loosely be defined as the delivery of services via often on-demand and fluidly scalable shared resources. This course explores the design and implementation of the full-stack of hardware and software necessary to implement the infrastructure for elastic, global-scale computing and storage clouds. Upon completion of the course students are expected to be able to design, implement, and analyze the infrastructure underlying cloud-based services. Topics include Data Center Networking; Distributed File Storage; Distributed Key-Value storage, including NoSQL Databases; Virtualization, and the management thereof; Resource Scheduling and Elasticity; Map-Reduce engines, and higher-level Frameworks. The course involves discussion based upon recent and landmark papers, as well as existing tools and software systems. It has a very substantial programming project component in which students design, implement, and analyze various aspects of cloud infrastructure.
INI14850 | INSuRE Cybersecurity Research: CYBERSE RSRCH SEM | https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/courseDetails?COURSE=14850&SEMESTER=F18 | instructors:Tague, Patrick prereq:18730 or 14741 description:This course engages students in real-world cybersecurity and information systems security problems of interest to government organizations and industry partners. Students will learn how to apply research techniques, think clearly about problems and constraints, formulate and analyze potential solutions, evaluate solutions through simulation and experimentation, and communicate their results effectively. Working in small groups under the mentorship of technical clients from government and industry, teams of students will formulate, carry out, and present original research on current cybersecurity/information assurance problems of interest. Project topics come from lists supplied by government and industry partners. The course will be synchronized with similar offerings at several partner schools via videoconference, using resources provided through the INSuRE program. The course will be open to graduate students in computer science and engineering (e.g., INI, CS, ECE, Information Systems, etc.) who have background in information security / information assurance and have significant expertise in at least one relevant technical area. All students will be initially waitlisted for the course until instructors have the chance to verify student qualifications beyond the basic prerequisites.
