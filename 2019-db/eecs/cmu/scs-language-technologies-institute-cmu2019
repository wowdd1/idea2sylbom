The course aims to cover the techniques used today in software that does useful things with text in human languages like English and Chinese. Applications of NLP include automatic translation between languages, extraction and summarization of information in documents, question answering and dialog systems, and conversational agents. This course will focus on core representations and algorithms, with some time spent on real-world applications. Because modern NLP relies so heavily on Machine Learning, well cover the basics of discrete classification and probabilistic modeling as we go. Good computational linguists also know about Linguistics, so topics in linguistics (phonology, morphology, and syntax) will be covered when fitting. From a software engineering perspective, there will be an emphasis on rapid prototyping, a useful skill in many other areas of Computer Science. In particular, we will introduce some high-level languages (e.g., regular expressions and Dyna) and some scripting languages (e.g., Python and Perl) that can greatly simplify prototype implementation.

LTI11661 | Language and Statistics: Language &amp; Statistics | https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/courseDetails?COURSE=11661&SEMESTER=F18 | instructors:Ramakrishnan, Bhiksha description:Language technologies (search, text mining, information retrieval, speech recognition, machine translation, question answering, biological sequence analysis...) are at the forefront of this centurys information revolution.  In addition to their use of machine learning, these technologies rely centrally on classic statistical estimation techniques.   Yet most CS and engineering undergraduate programs do not prepare students in this area beyond an introductory probstats course.  This course is designed to plug this hole.  The goal of Language and Statistics is to ground the data-driven techniques used in language technologies in sound statistical methodology.   We start by formulating various language technology problems in both an information theoretic framework (the source-channel paradigm) and a Bayesian framework (the Bayes classifier).  We then discuss the statistical properties of words, sentences, documents and whole languages, and the computational formalisms used to represent language.  These discussions naturally lead to specific concepts in statistical estimation.  Topics include: Zipfs distribution and type-token curves; point estimators, Maximum Likelihood estimation, bias and variance, sparseness, smoothing and clustering; interpolation, shrinkage, and backoff; entropy, cross entropy and mutual information;  decision tree models applied to language; latent variable models and the EM algorithm; hidden Markov models; exponential models and maximum entropy; semantic modeling and dimensionality reduction; probabilistic context-free grammars and syntactic language models.  The course is designed for LTI  SCS graduate students, but others are welcome.  CS UG upperclassmen whove taken it have done well, though they found it challenging.  The 11-661 version does not require the course project.  Prerequisites: Strong quantitative aptitude.  Comfort with basic UG-level probability.  Some programming skill.

Students will be introduced to a particular firm (through one of the program advisors) and will learn how to conduct and develop requirements analysis and convert that into feature definition. The customer requirements are often a moving target: theyre influenced by the emergence of competitive alternatives (e.g. internal consultants, off-the-shelf software) and also by the team interaction with each others. Students will learn to create a product that best captures the best balance of the customer priorities and feasibility and distinguishing it from competitive alternatives. They will then use this learning to develop their respective prototypes. At the conclusion of the term, teams will compete with each other to determine which teams product is superior. In addition to having to apply various aspects of software development and computational learning, the course will help to provide students with some key insights into how biotech/pharmaceutical businesses operate.        In addition to concepts regarding market demand, students will learn how to aggregate and synthesize information related to demand, pricing and competition. They will then apply this learning to define and prioritize market driven requirements as it relates to a product. This information will then be used to build a product development plan. Students will utilize methods to enhance product quality and customer satisfaction: benchmarking; industry and customer analyses; project metrics, and a range of customer relationship management tools.

We hope to have students from a variety disciplines (linguistics, computer science, psychology, modern languages, philosophy) in order to cover a broad perspective in class discussions. Comparison of formalisms will lead to a deeper understanding of human language and natural language processing algorithms. The formalisms will include: Head Driven Phrase Structure Grammar, Lexical Functional Grammar, Tree Adjoining Grammar and Categorial Grammar. If time permits, we will cover Penn Treebank, dependency grammar, and Construction Grammar. We will cover the treatment of basic syntactic and semantic phenomena in each formalism, and will also discuss algorithms for parsing and generating sentences for each formalism. If time permits, we may discuss formal language theory and generative capacity.

The course is self-paced and there will be no scheduled lecture times, however, students are welcome to set up meetings with the instructor as desired, and students who prefer to have a weekly or bi-monthly regularly scheduled meeting with the instructor are welcome to arrange for that. If there is sufficient interest, an informal reading group may be formed to supplement the lab work.    Students will design their own project, which they will discuss with the instructor for approval. Students are encouraged to select a topic from semantics, pragmatics, or discourse analysis, such as entailment, evidentiality, implicature, information status, or rhetorical structure, and a topic from language technologies, such as sentiment analysis or summarization, and explore how the linguistic topic applies to some aspect of the chosen language technology. Students are encouraged to contrast symbolic, formal, and knowledge based approaches with empirical approaches.    Each student will work independently. If multiple students work as a team on a particular topic, each should choose an approach that is different from the approaches used by the other students working on the same problem. Students will be responsible to set up a web page, blog, or wiki to post progress reports and other supporting documents, data, and analyses. The web space will be checked by the instructor periodically , and thus should be kept updated in order to reflect on-going progress. The web space will also serve as a shared project space in the case that students are working in a team for the project.

This class will start with a brief overview of neural networks, then spend the majority of the class demonstrating how to apply neural networks to natural language problems. Each section class will introduce a particular problem or phenomenon in natural language, describe why it is difficult to model, and demonstrate several models that were designed to tackle this problem. In the process of doing so, the class will cover different techniques that are useful in creating models, including handling variably sized and structured sentences, efficient handling of large data, semi-supervised and unsupervised learning, structured prediction, and multilingual modeling.
LTI11751 | Speech Recognition and Understanding | https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/courseDetails?COURSE=11751&SEMESTER=F18 | instructors:Metze, Florian description:The technology to allow humans to communicate by speech with machines or by which machines can understand when humans communicate with each other is rapidly maturing. This course provides an introduction to the theoretical tools as well as the experimental practice that has made the field what it is today. We will cover theoretical foundations, essential algorithms, major approaches, experimental strategies and current state-of-the-art systems and will introduce the participants to ongoing work in representation, algorithms and interface design.

While the 11-751 speech course focussed on an introduction to the theoretical foundations, essential algorithms, major approaches, and strategies for current state-of-the-art systems, the 11-753 speech lab complements the education by concentrating on the experimental practice in developing speech recognition and understanding speech-based systems, and by getting hands-on experience on relevant research questions using state-of-the art tools. Possible problem sets include both core speech recognition technology, and the integration of speech-based components into multi-modal, semantic, learning, or otherwise complex systems and interfaces.
LTI11754 | Project Course: Dialogue Systems | https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/courseDetails?COURSE=11754&SEMESTER=S19 | instructors:Black, AlanRudnicky, Alexander description:This course will teach participants how to implement a complete spoken language system while providing opportunities to explore research topics of interest in the context of a functioning system. The course will produce a complete implementation of a system to access and manipulate email through voice only, for example to allow users to interact with the mail system over a telephone while away from their computer. In doing so the class will address the component activities of spoken language system building. These include, but are not limited to, task analysis and language design, application-specific acoustic and language modeling, grammar design, task design, dialog management, language generation and synthesis. The course will place particular emphasis on issues in task design and dialog management and on issues in language generation and synthesis.     For Fall, we will implement a simple telephone-based information access application. The domain is bus schedules (see http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/BusLine for a web-based interface to this domain) and the goal will be to create one or more usable applications that can provide a real service and can be deployed for actual use by the University community. Participants will chose individual components of the system to concentrate on and will collaborate to put together the entire system. It is perfectly acceptable for several individuals to concentrate on a single component, particularly if their work will exemplify alternative approaches to the same problem.
LTI11755 | Machine Learning for Signal Processing | https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/courseDetails?COURSE=11755&SEMESTER=F18 | instructors:Ramakrishnan, Bhiksha description:Signal Processing is the science that deals with extraction of information from signals of various kinds. This has two distinct aspects -- characterization and categorization. Traditionally, signal characterization has been performed with mathematically-driven transforms, while categorization and classification are achieved using statistical tools.     Machine learning aims to design algorithms that learn about the state of the world directly from data.     A increasingly popular trend has been to develop and apply machine learning techniques to both aspects of signal processing, often blurring the distinction between the two.     This course discusses the use of machine learning techniques to process signals. We cover a variety of topics, from data driven approaches for characterization of signals such as audio including speech, images and video, and machine learning methods for a variety of speech and image processing problems.
LTI11761 | Language and Statistics: Language &amp; Statistics | https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/courseDetails?COURSE=11761&SEMESTER=F18 | instructors:Ramakrishnan, Bhiksha description:Language technologies (search, text mining, information retrieval, speech recognition, machine translation, question answering, biological sequence analysis...) are at the forefront of this centurys information revolution.  In addition to their use of machine learning, these technologies rely centrally on classic statistical estimation techniques.   Yet most CS and engineering undergraduate programs do not prepare students in this area beyond an introductory probstats course.  This course is designed to plug this hole.  The goal of Language and Statistics is to ground the data-driven techniques used in language technologies in sound statistical methodology.   We start by formulating various language technology problems in both an information theoretic framework (the source-channel paradigm) and a Bayesian framework (the Bayes classifier).  We then discuss the statistical properties of words, sentences, documents and whole languages, and the computational formalisms used to represent language.  These discussions naturally lead to specific concepts in statistical estimation.  Topics include: Zipfs distribution and type-token curves; point estimators, Maximum Likelihood estimation, bias and variance, sparseness, smoothing and clustering; interpolation, shrinkage, and backoff; entropy, cross entropy and mutual information;  decision tree models applied to language; latent variable models and the EM algorithm; hidden Markov models; exponential models and maximum entropy; semantic modeling and dimensionality reduction; probabilistic context-free grammars and syntactic language models.  The course is designed for LTI  SCS graduate students, but others are welcome.  CS UG upperclassmen whove taken it have done well, though they found it challenging.  The 11-661 version does not require the course project.  Prerequisites: Strong quantitative aptitude.  Comfort with basic UG-level probability.  Some programming skill.
LTI11775 | Large-Scale Multi-Media Analysis | https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/courseDetails?COURSE=11775&SEMESTER=S19 | instructors:Hauptmann, AlexanderMetze, Florian description:Can a robot watch Youtube to learn about the world? What makes us laugh? How to bake a cake? Why is Kim Kardashian famous?  12-unit class covering fundamentals of computer vision, audio and speech processing, multi-media files and streaming, multi-modal signal processing, video retrieval, semantics, and text (possibly also: speech, music) generation.  Instructors will give an overview of relevant recent work and benchmarking efforts (Trecvid, Mediaeval, etc.). Students will work on research projects to explore these ideas and learn to perform multi-modal retrieval, summarization and inference on large amounts of Youtube-style data. The experimental environment for the practical part of the course will be given to students in the form of Virtual Machines.
LTI11776 | Multimodal Affective Computing: Multimodal Affective Computing | https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/courseDetails?COURSE=11776&SEMESTER=S19 | instructors:Morency, Louis-Philippe description:Humans are highly social creatures and have evolved complex mechanisms for signaling information about their thoughts, feelings, and intentions (both deliberately and reflexively). In turn, humans have also evolved complex mechanisms for receiving these signals and inferring the thoughts, feelings, and intentions of others. Proper understanding of human behavior, in all its nuance, requires careful consideration and integration of verbal, vocal, and visual information. These communication dynamics have long been studied in psychology and other social sciences. More recently, the field of multimodal affective computing has sought to enhance these studies using techniques from computer science and artificial intelligence. Common topics of study in this field include affective states, cognitive states, personality, psychopathology, social processes, and communication. As such, multimodal affective computing has broad applicability in both scientific and applied settings ranging from medicine and education to robotics and marketing.     The objectives of this course are:  (1)    To give an overview of the components of human behavior (verbal, vocal, and visual) and the computer science areas that measure them (NLP, speech processing, and computer vision)  (2)    To provide foundational knowledge of psychological constructs commonly studied in multimodal affective computing (e.g., emotion, personality, and psychopathology)  (3)    To provide practical instruction on using statistical tools to study research hypotheses  (4)    To provide information about computational predictive models that integrate multimodal information from the verbal, vocal, and visual modalities  (5)    To give students practical experience in the computational study of human behavior and psychological constructs through an in-depth course project
LTI11777 | Advanced Multimodal Machine Learning | https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/courseDetails?COURSE=11777&SEMESTER=F18 | instructors:Morency, Louis-Philippe description:Multimodal machine learning (MMML) is a vibrant multi-disciplinary research field which addresses some of the original goals of artificial intelligence by integrating and modeling multiple communicative modalities, including linguistic, acoustic and visual messages. With the initial research on audio-visual speech recognition and more recently with language vision projects such as image and video captioning, this research field brings some unique challenges for multimodal researchers given the heterogeneity of the data and the contingency often found between modalities.     The course will present the fundamental mathematical concepts in machine learning and deep learning relevant to the five main challenges in multimodal machine learning: (1) multimodal representation learning, (2) translation  mapping, (3) modality alignment, (4) multimodal fusion and (5) co-learning.  These include, but not limited to, multimodal auto-encoder, deep canonical correlation analysis, multi-kernel learning, attention models and multimodal recurrent neural networks. We will also review recent papers describing state-of-the-art probabilistic models and computational algorithms for MMML and discuss the current and upcoming challenges. The course will discuss many of the recent applications of MMML including multimodal affect recognition, image and video captioning and cross-modal multimedia retrieval.     This is a graduate course designed primarily for PhD and research master students at LTI, MLD, CSD, HCII and RI; others, for example (undergraduate) students of CS or from professional master programs, are advised to seek prior permission of the instructor. It is strongly recommended for students to have taken an introduction machine learning course such as 10-401, 10-601, 10-701, 11-663, 11-441, 11-641 or 11-741. Prior knowledge of deep learning is recommended but not required.
LTI11782 | Self-Paced Lab for Computational Biology | https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/courseDetails?COURSE=11782&SEMESTER=F18 | instructors:Xing, Eric prereq:10810 description:Students will choose from a set of projects designed by the instructor. Students will also have the option of designing their own projects, subject to instructor approval. For the students who had completed a project in the 10-810 course, they can either switch to another project, or continue working on the previous project by aiming a significant progress (subject to instructor approval). Each student will work independently. If more than one student work on a particular topic, each should choose an approach that is different from the approaches used by the other students working on the same problem. The students need to begin with a project proposal to outline the high-level ideas, tasks, and goals of the problem, and plan of experiments and/or analysis. The instructor will consult with you on your ideas , but the final responsibility to define and execute an interesting piece of work is yours. Your project will have two final deliverables: 1. a writeup in the form of a NIPS paper (8 pages maximum in NIPS format, including references), worth 60 of the project grade, and 2. a research seminar presentation of your work at the end of the semester, worth 20 of the project grade. In addition, you must turn in a midway progress report (5 pages maximum in NIPS format, including references) describing the results of your first experiments, worth 20 of the project grade. Note that, as with any conference, the page limits are strict Papers over the limit will not be considered. The grading of your project are based on overall scientific quality, novelty, writing, and clarity of presentation. We expect your final report to be of conference-paper quality, and you are expected to also deliver software implementation of your algorithmic results.
LTI11783 | Self-Paced Lab: Rich Interaction in Virtual World | https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/courseDetails?COURSE=11783&SEMESTER=S19 | instructors:Metze, Florian prereq:11751 and 18781 and 18799 description:Massively Multi-player Online Role-Playing Games have evolved into Virtual Worlds (VWs), and are creating ever richer environments for experimentation on all aspects of human to human, or human to machine communication, as well as for information discovery and access. So far, interaction has been constrained by the limited capabilities of keyboards, joysticks, or computer mice. This creates an exciting opportunity for explorative research on speech input and output, speech-to-speech translation, or any aspect of language technology. Of particular interest will be a combination with other novel real world (RW) input, or output devices, such as mobile phones or portable games consoles, because they can be used to control the VW, or make it accessible everywhere in RW. Language technologies in particular profit from context awareness, because domain adaptation can be performed. For scientific experimentation in that area, Virtual Worlds offer the opportunity to concentrate on algorithms, because context sensors can be written with a few lines of code, without the need for extra hardware sensors. Algorithms can also run continuously, without the need for specific data collection times or places, because the VW is always on.    In this lab, we will enhance existing clients to virtual worlds so that they can connect to various speech and language related research systems developed at LTI and CMUs Silicon Valley campus. The lab will be held jointly at the CMUs Pittsburgh and Silicon Valley Campuses. We will eat our own dog food, so the goal will be to hold the last session entirely in a virtual class room, which will by that time include speech control of virtual equipment, speech-to-speech translation, and some devices that can be controlled using non-PC type equipment, like mobile phones. Eventually, this virtual room or the know-how gathered
LTI11785 | Introduction to Deep Learning | https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/courseDetails?COURSE=11785&SEMESTER=S19 | instructors:Ramakrishnan, Bhiksha description:Neural networks have increasingly taken over various AI tasks, and currently produce the state of the art in many AI tasks ranging from computer vision and planning for self-driving cars to playing computer games. Basic knowledge of NNs, known currently in the popular literature as deep learning, familiarity with various formalisms, and knowledge of tools, is now an essential requirement for any researcher or developer in most AI and NLP fields. This course is a broad introduction to the field of neural networks and their deep learning formalisms. The course traces some of the development of neural network theory and design through time, leading quickly to a discussion of various network formalisms, including simple feedforward, convolutional, recurrent, and probabilistic formalisms, the rationale behind their development, and challenges behind learning such networks and various proposed solutions. We subsequently cover various extensions and models that enable their application to various tasks such as computer vision, speech recognition, machine translation and playing games. Instruction Unlike prior editions of 11-785, the instruction will primarily be through instructor lectures, and the occasional guest lecture. Evaluation Students will be evaluated based on weekly continuous-evaluation tests, and their performance in assignments and a final course project. There will be six hands-on assignments, requiring both low-level coding and toolkit-based implementation of neural networks, covering basic MLP, convolutional and recurrent formalisms, as well as one or more advanced tasks, in addition to the final project.

Lang. | https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/courseDetails?COURSE=11823&SEMESTER=S19 | instructors:Black, AlanLevin, Lorraine description:Students will work individually or in small groups to create artificial human(oid) languages for fictional human cultures or SciFi worlds.  Students will implement language technologies for their languages.  In the course of creating the languages, students will learn about the building blocks of human language such as phones, phonemes, morphemes, and morpho-syntactic constructions including their semantics and pragmatics.    Class instruction will focus specifically on variation among human languages so that the students can make conlangs that are not just naively English-like.   We will also touch on philosophical issues in philosophy of language and on real-world socio-political issues related to language policy.     Students will be required to use at least one of the following technologies:  language documentation tools that are used for field linguistics and corpus annotation, automatic speech recognition, speech synthesis, morphological analysis, parsing, or machine translation.       Learning Objectives:  1.  The building blocks (phonemes, morphemes, etc.) of language, how languages are built from them, and how they interact  2.  Metalinguistic awareness and knowledge about variation in human language   3.  Language, thought, and culture:  how does language reflect thought and culture, and vice versa.   Why wouldnt Elvish be a good language for Klingons?    4.  Language policy in the real world:  For students who want to manipulate real languages.  5.  Historical linguistics and language change:  for students who want to manipulate real languages or make families of related conlangs for fictional worlds.    6.  Practical experience with a language technology.  http://tts.speech.cs.cmu.edu/11-823/
LTI11830 | Computational Ethics for NLP | https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/courseDetails?COURSE=11830&SEMESTER=S19 | instructors:Black, AlanTsvetkov, Yulia description:As language technologies have become increasingly prevalent, there is a growing awareness that  decisions we make about our data, methods, and tools are often tied up with their impact on people  and societies. This course introduces students to real-world applications of language technologies  and the potential ethical implications associated with their design.     The class will study advanced topics in Natural Language Processing, in or near the intersection  of Machine Learning, Linguistics, and Computational Social Science. Centered around classical and  state-of-the-art research, lectures will cover philosophical foundations of ethical research along with  concrete case studies and ethical challenges in development of intelligent systems. Methodologically,  we will discuss how to analyze large scale text generated by people to or about other people and  how to reason about it through text-, network-, and people-centered models. From an engineering  perspective, there will be an emphasis on practical design and implementation of useful and ethical  AI systems, with annotation and coding assignments and a course project.     Topics include: misrepresentation and bias, including algorithms to identify biases in models  and data and adversarial approaches to debiasing; privacy algorithms for demographic inference,  personality profiling, and anonymization of demographic and personality traits; techniques to monitor  civility in communication, and detecting trolling, hate speech, abusive language, cyberbullying,  and toxic comments; propaganda and manipulation in news, and methods to identify fake news  and political framing; healthcare and biomedical text processing and applications; low-resource  NLP and its applications for disaster response and monitoring diseases in developing regions.  http://demo.clab.cs.cmu.edu/ethical_nlp/
LTI11910 | Directed Research | https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/courseDetails?COURSE=11910&SEMESTER=S19 | instructors:Frederking, Robert description:This course number documents the research being done by Masters and pre-proposal PhD students. Beginning in Fall 2001, every LTI graduate student will register for at least 24 units of 11-910 each semester, unless they are ABD (i.e., they have had a thesis proposal accepted), in which case they should register for 48 units of 11-930. The student will be expected to write a report and give a presentation at the end of the semester, documenting the research done. The report will be filed by either the faculty member or the LTI graduate program administrator.   (Until Fall 2001 this course number was used for individual study in connection with LTI project research work and was a Pass/Fail course.)
LTI11920 | Independent Study: Breadth | https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/courseDetails?COURSE=11920&SEMESTER=S19 | instructors:Frederking, Robert description:This course number is intended for individual study with faculty other than a students intended thesis advisor.
LTI11925 | Independent Study: Area | https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/courseDetails?COURSE=11925&SEMESTER=S19 | instructors:Frederking, Robert description:This course number is intended for individual study with the intended thesis advisor prior to acceptance of a students thesis proposal.
LTI11927 | MIIS Capstone Project | https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/courseDetails?COURSE=11927&SEMESTER=F18 | instructors:Brown, Ralf description:The capstone project course is a group-oriented demonstration of student skill in one or more areas covered by the degree. Typically the result of the capstone project is a major software application. The capstone project course consists of two components.  The classroom component guides students in project planning, team management, development of requirements and design specifications, and software tools for managing group-oriented projects.  The lab component provides project-specific technical guidance and expertise, for example in the development of a question answering system, dialog, or sentiment analysis application.  Thus, each project receives two types of supervision, often from two separate members of the faculty.
LTI11928 | Masters Thesis I | https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/courseDetails?COURSE=11928&SEMESTER=F18 | instructors:Frederking, Robert description:This course number is intended for last semester Masters students who wish to do an optional Masters Thesis.
LTI11929 | Masters Thesis II | https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/courseDetails?COURSE=11929&SEMESTER=S19 | instructors:Frederking, Robert description:This course number is intended for last semester Masters students who wish to do an optional Masters Thesis. The student will normally have taken 11-925 Independent Study: Area of Concentration for 12 units in the preceding semester, to produce an MS Thesis Proposal.
LTI11930 | Dissertation Research | https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/courseDetails?COURSE=11930&SEMESTER=S19 | instructors:Frederking, Robert description:This course number is intended for PhD dissertation research after acceptance of a students PhD thesis proposal.
