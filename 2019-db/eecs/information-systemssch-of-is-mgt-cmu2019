We aim at answering questions such as how does the demand for a product change when the price does or the ratings do? How can we anticipate how sales and profits change if the firm changes its business strategy? Facebook, Google, Amazon and similar firms ask and answer questions of this kind everyday using their large online platforms.  This course introduces fundamental concepts to correctly ask this type of question. We study frameworks to measure causal effects and we discuss their pros and cons. Every tool is discussed in the context of a specific example that students work on using real world datasets. Significant effort is placed on understanding how to design randomized experiments (aka A/B tests) to measure causal effects. We also discuss the most common challenges that arise when trying to design such experiments in the wild and in network settings. The concepts and tools discussed in this course are general in nature and can be applied in settings other than online platforms such as energy, transportation and education. The examples in class will be mostly drawn from our own work at the Heinz College on the media industry.  Lectures are 3 hours long. In the first half of each lecture we go over concepts behind A/B tests and what to do when A/B tests are unavailable. The discussion is based on the ideas and intuition behind these concepts. In the second half of each lecture we go over specific examples -- we study the associated datasets and the code used to analyze them properly. Student evaluation is based on five weekly homeworks and a brief term project to be developed in teams.

Machine learning is transforming fields with new capabilities, ways of understanding and visualizing data, and is becoming a key driver in decision making. However, knowing when (and how) to apply appropriate machine learning techniques requires understanding of data, machine learning, and the problem domain. This class seeks to teach students how to address the entire machine learning pipeline, starting from messy data and provisional questions and ending with actionable interpretations and insights.  The course will cover discovery, planning, analysis, and interpretation. Discovery involves understanding the data at hand, determining what is and is not answerable, and question generation. Planning involves contrasting the application of the desired machine learning method on ideal clean data with the messy data at hand. Dealing with representation, missing data, and designing appropriate machine learning machinery are all involved in planning. Analysis involves applying the machine learning method, checking model performance and assumptions in a principled and responsible manner. Interpretation involves the transformation of algorthm outputs into meaningful and actionable characterizations of the results. Each part of the pipeline is interconnected and students will learn to anticipate and address limitations through understanding of the pipeline as a whole.  Throughout the course we will focus on one vertical, health care, recognizing that the methods developed will generalize to others. We will work with real, messy, structured and unstructed data--including databases, text, and images. We will contrast machine learning methods against what is currently used in health care analytics, and describe the advantages and promise of each.

ISM95865 | Unstructured Data Analytics | https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/courseDetails?COURSE=95865&SEMESTER=S19 | instructors:Chen, George prereq:95888 description:Many organizations need to analyze large amounts of data such as text, images, audio, and video to discover useful information. For example, a company may want to monitor how the public discusses its products in social media, or a forensics team may need to discover the contents of disk drives seized by law enforcement. A recurring issue is that we often do not know what structure is present in the data initially. This course provides students with an understanding of common and emerging methods of organizing, summarizing, and analyzing large collections of this unstructured data (unstructured data analytics). There is a heavy emphasis on hands-on programming experience. For students with very limited or no programming experience or who are after a more conceptual exposition, consider taking 94-775 instead.  Learning Objectives:  By the end of the course, students are expected to have developed the following skills. Skills are assessed by the homework assignments and the final exam.   * Recall and discuss common methods of conducting exploratory and predictive analysis of unstructured data;  * Write Python code for exploratory and predictive data analysis that handles large datasets; and  * Work with the Amazon AWS cloud computing platform; and * Apply unstructured data analysis techniques discussed in class to solve problems faced by governments and companies.   Prerequisites:  Python programming experience. If you do not already know Python, we will expect that you pick it up fairly rapidly on your own (this should be possible if you are already very comfortable coding in a different high-level programming language such as R or MATLAB).   Note that there will be a fair amount of coding in Python and working with sufficiently large datasets. We will be making use of standard Python machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn and keras.
ISM95866 | Advanced Business Analytics | https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/courseDetails?COURSE=95866&SEMESTER=S19 | instructors:Li, Beibei description:Growth in Web 2.0 coincides with the growth in firms ability to collect large customer data. Firms know micro level data about customer transactions and have an ability to correlate such data with other datasets. In this course, we will learn powerful but simple probability/statistical models that can be applied to fit these data to generate useful predictions. The course will go beyond pattern detections, clustering, or correlation in data to build models of plausible consumer behavior that generates the data. Thus the goal is to build a model of consumer behavior and apply this model to data to test how accurate this model is and tweak it if necessary. Most importantly, with such a model in hand, we want to predict how outcomes will change if the firm changed its strategy. Thus a key goal of the course is to teach students a model based approach to prediction.

Students are moved from wait list to the course based on various factors. Please come to the first class even if you are on the waiting list.   This course assumes no significant programming exposure, and is more highly structured to support the students that may or may not have a significant programming background.  The course 95-882, Enterprise Web Development,  does assume some previous programming experience, and is less structured, for example it supports more flexibility in the choice of course project.  The course content will be different, meaning that 95-881 is not a subset of 95-882.  The web browser has become a major platform for application development, and its development is fundamentally different from traditional general purpose programming.  This course focuses on the fundamentals of web development using the browser as a platform with a focus on the client-side web application. The students in pairs or individually will design and develop a web application over the lifetime of the course.   The development aspect will include HTML, Javascript and Javascript libraries, such as jQuery. This is not simply a programming course.  A major emphasis is on the use of web programming patterns to enhance the front end user experience with established features.  Patterns include input validation, featured content, coach marks, natural language input, recommendations, and others.  The programming will include how to implement these features that are designed specifically for the front-end web, namely to enhance the user experience.  Course evaluation will include weekly quizzes based on assigned readings, a cumulative final exam and a course project which is the web application that the students will build.

Students are moved from wait list to the course based on various factors. Please come to the first class even if you are on the waiting list.   This course assumes some previous programming exposure (variables, arrays, loops, and decision structure). Students without much programming experience should take 95-881, Web Application Development, which does not assume as much programming experience, and is much more structured to support students with less programming exposure.  The course content will be different, meaning that 95-881 is not a subset of 95-882.  Enterprise web applications are a complex relationship between the client, server, and any additional back-end services.  Web systems are becoming more supportive of users such that the system must adapt based on the needs and behaviors of the users.  This course will support the understanding of the data that drives the enterprise web development, which includes the analysis of web traffic and usage, ads, and the personalization of the web experience.    This course focuses on the development of an enterprise web application with specific emphasis on the server-side enterprise web application programming and an n-tier system approach.  The students in teams will design and develop a full enterprise web application including an n-tier implementation over the lifetime of the course. The development aspect will include server programming languages and systems (such as PHP, Django, Node) and database support (such as mySQL) as well as appropriate front-end development.

Like archaeological remnants, data, by its very nature, is a marker of what happened in the past. How can data be used to better understand this past and what is happening in the present? How can data be leveraged to forecast what will happen in the future? Better still, how can data be used to mold what should happen in the future? In this course we will study descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive methods by which data can be used to gain insight and inform actions of people and organizations. The real excitement of data science is in the doing. This is an application oriented course requiring skill in algorithmic problem solving. We will use Python based data science tools. While prior programming experience with Python will be helpful the course will strive to be self-contained. If you have not programmed in Python before, you need to be comfortable programming in some language (e.g., Ruby, R, Java, C++) and will need to come up to speed with the Pythonic way of problem solving.   *95885 can not be taken as grade options of pass/fail or auditing. Course needs to be taken for a letter grade. *To satisfy the prerequisite, students must take one (1) of the courses listed below.  Students who have not taken a prerequisite course may be able to demonstrate Pythonic way of problem solving through professional work experience.
